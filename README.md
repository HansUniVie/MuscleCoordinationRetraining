# MuscleCoordinationRetraining

This repository includes 3 scripts which were used in the following publication to 
1) create the input data for Monte Carlo simulations
2) run Monte Carlo simulations using parallel computing in Matlab
3) Summarize the muscle and joint contact forces from the simulations

Additionally the repository includes all musculoskeletal OpenSim models and experimental input data for the simulations.

Monte Carlo simulations are based on the static optimization script from Scott Uhlrich https://github.com/stanfordnmbl/MatlabStaticOptimization

# Instructions

Use the 01_Montecarlo_parallel_input_example.m script to run the code to create the input data for the Monte Carlo simulations.

Use the 02_MontecarloSimulation_parallel_example.m script to run the code for the Monte Carlo simulations.

Use the 03_SummarizeResults_eample.m script to run the code to summarize the findings from a participant.
